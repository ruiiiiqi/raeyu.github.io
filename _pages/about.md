I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in [Operations Research and Financial Engineering](https://orfe.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University, advised by [Matias Cattaneo](https://cattaneo.princeton.edu/). My research interests lie in **causal inference**, **econometrics** and **mathematical statistics**.

My goal is to develop methodologies for estimation and uncertainty quantification in causal inference and econometrics problems, particularly in complex data settings. My work includes causal inference via **regression discontinuity designs**, under **network interference**, and for **climate data**. I am also interested in causal inference based on **text data**.

Beyond causal inference, I work on mathematical statistics problems abstracted from causal applications. My research includes:
- **Strong Gaussian approximation** for empirical processes, which provides theoretical justifications for the validity of confidence bands.
- **Berry-Esseen bounds** for the magnetization of the Ising model with independent multipliers.

I also have a growing interest in **theoretical machine learning** and am actively seeking collaborative projects in this area.

Prior to this, I obtained a Honors Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Its Application in Financial Economics at University of Toronto in 2021, where I worked as a research assistant for [Yosh Halberstam](https://yoshhalberstam.github.io/).
