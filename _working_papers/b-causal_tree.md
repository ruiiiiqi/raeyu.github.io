title: "On the Invalidity of Heterogeneous Causal Effect Estimation via Recursive Decision Trees"
authors: "Matias D. Cattaneo, Jason M. Klusowski, Ruiqi (Rae) Yu"

abstract: "Recursive partitioning is now a common tool of choice in the analysis of heterogeneous causal treatment effects 
and the design of heterogeneous policy interventions, an application where accurate pointwise estimates over the entire 
covariate domain is needed. We show that in the constant treatment effect model, the causal decision tree based on CART 
methodology can not converge faster than polynomial-in-n. Shallow (honest) causal decision tree estimators are hence shown to be inconsistent, 
as a function of the sample size, for some point in the covariate domain."
